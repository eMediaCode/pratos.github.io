I'm Prathamesh and thanks for reading my blog. This blog is a collection of all the exciting things and learnings from daily activities at [Office](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/3607025/) and home.

The reason for naming the blog as `/thoth` was that I'm a doodle man and like to scribble/write on plain sheets of paper. 
> [Thoth](http://www.crystalinks.com/thoth.html) is the Egyptian deity that overlooks many aspects of life, but is primarily associated with Writing and Scribes. 

The origins for majority of my blog posts are a way to keep track of the crazy polygotish things that I get myself involved with, mostly scribbling them in Markdown on Jupyter notebooks or Sublime Text Editor.

I'll be reachable at <b style="text-decoration: none; color:#0c556b; hover:black;">pratham[dot]sarang9[at]gmail[dot]com.</b>
