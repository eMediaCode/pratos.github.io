title: Problems of Data Science in Production & Collaboration
---

[Under Editing]
Sometimes the biggest hurdles aren't exactly what you think would be. Data Science problems are unique in that respect. It is like loving someone so dearly, made for each other but there are problems getting married.

With my brief stint in Data Science/Business Analytics, there have been few common pain points faced by us Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineers. Data Science attracts a beavy of individuals from diverse backgrounds, but let's be honest we bitch about our machine setups and resources more than our projects. This is the first issue that probably all the Data Science practitioners face - Corporate redtape & financial constraints in startups. These are things that are beyond our control, ranting over it wouldn't be advisable.

The second most difficult part in this whole exercise of being a Data Science practitioner is we were taught about the nuts & bolts of Data Science. Generic workflow of a typical individual would be as follows:

$$\textbf{Load Data} \longRightarrow \textbf{Data Pre-processing} \longRightarrow \textbf{Feature Engineering} \longRightarrow \textbf{Machine Learning Models} \longRightarrow \textbf{Predictions}$$

A fairly straight-forward approach, but this illusion shatters once we step in the big-bad world of poorly written APIs or worse a sandboxed SQL Data Dump with 100+ tables *shudders* with no data dictionary *shoots himself*. We aren't exactly prepared for all this and true to the claim - Data Science is 80% data cleaning. 

As a part of an exercise to 

These are all personal opinions and would be interesting to know about
